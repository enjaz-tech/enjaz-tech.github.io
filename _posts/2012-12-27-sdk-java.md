**enjaz tech eCommerce Java SDK**

All imlplementations require certification with sandbox environement before moving to production. Once certified for the use of agiven version, ENJAZ identifies the current version of your application and allows you to move it to the Production Environment. Updating your code without recertification will result in transaction declines. Please consult you Implementation Analyst for additional information about this process.

This SDK was implemented to support the Java programming language and was created by ENJAZ. Its intended use is for online transaction processing utilizing your account on ENJAZ payments engine.


Please contact ENJAZ to receive valid merchant credentials in order to run tests successfully or if you require assistance in any way.
