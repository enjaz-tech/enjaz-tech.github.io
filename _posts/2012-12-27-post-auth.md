The Authorization transaction enables you to confirm that a customer has submitted a valid payment method with their order and has sufficient funds to purchase the goods or services they ordered. Setting the < allowPartialAuth > element to true in the Authorization request enables the system to return authorizations for a portion of the order amount for cases where the card does not have an adequate credit limit or balance available for the full amount.

An approved Authorization reduces the customer's credit limit (or bank balance, in the case of a debit card) by the amount of the approval by placing the amount on hold. If you have the Prepaid Indicator feature enabled, the Authorization response also includes an element that indicates if the card is Prepaid, as well as an element indicating the available balance on the card.
